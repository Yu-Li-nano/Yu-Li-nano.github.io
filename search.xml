(Abstract) In resistive random access memories, modeling conductive filament growing dynamics is important to understand the switching mechanism and variability. In this paper, a universal Monte Carlo simulator is developed based on a cell switching model and a tunneling-based transport model. Driven by external electric field, the growing process of the nanoscale filament occurring in the gap region is actually dominated by cells’ conductive/insulating switching, modeled through a phenomenological physics-based probability function. The electric transport through the partially formed CF is considered as current tunneling in the framework of the Quantum Point Contact model, and the potential barrier is modulated during cells’ evolution. To demonstrate the validity and universality of our simulator, various operation schemes are simulated, with the simulated I-V characteristics well explaining experimental observations. Furthermore, the statistical analyses of simulation results in terms of Weibull distribution and conductance evolution also nicely track previous experimental results. Representing a simulation scale that links atomic-scale simulations to compact modeling, our simulator has the advantage of being much faster comparing with other atomic-scale models. Meanwhile, our simulator shows good universality since it can be applied to various operation signals, and also to different electrodes and dielectric layers dominated by different switching mechanisms.

<p>(Abstract) Reversible chemical and structural changes induced by ionic motion and reaction in response to electrical stimuli leads to resistive switching effects in metal-insulator-metal structures. Filamentary switching based on the formation and rupture of nanoscale conductive filament has been applied in non-volatile memory and volatile selector devices with low power consumption and fast switching speeds. Before the mass production of resistive switching devices, great efforts are still required to enable stable and reliable switching performances. The conductive filament, a bridge of microscopic metal-insulator-metal structure and macroscopic resistance states, plays an irreplaceable part in resistive switching behavior, as unreliable performance often originates from unstable filament behavior. In this Review, departing from the filamentary switching mechanism and the existing issues, recent advances of the switching performance improvement through the conductive filament modulation are discussed, in the sequence of material modulation, device structure design and switching operation scheme optimization. In particular, two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials with excellent properties including and beyond graphene, are discussed with emphasis on performance improvement by their active roles as the switching layer, insertion layer, thin electrode, patterned electrode, and edge electrode, etc.</p>

    <title>Mechanism of resistive switching in HfO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-based memristors</title>

(Abstract) The resistive switching effect in memristors typically stems from the formation and rupture of localized conductive filament paths, and HfO<sub>2</sub> has been accepted as one of the most promising resistive switching materials. However, the dynamic changes in the resistive switching process, including the composition and structure of conductive filaments, and especially the evolution of conductive filament surroundings, remain controversial in HfO<sub>2</sub>-based memristors. Here, the conductive filament system in the amorphous HfO<sub>2</sub>-based memristors with various top electrodes is revealed to be with a quasi-core-shell structure consisting of metallic hexagonal-Hf<sub>6</sub>O and its crystalline surroundings (monoclinic or tetragonal HfO<sub>x</sub>). The phase of the HfO<sub>x</sub> shell varies with the oxygen reservation capability of the top electrode. According to extensive high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations and ab initio calculations, the phase transition of the conductive filament shell between monoclinic and tetragonal HfO<sub>2</sub> is proposed to depend on the comprehensive effects of Joule heat from the conductive filament current and the concentration of oxygen vacancies. The quasi-core-shell conductive filament system with an intrinsic barrier, which prohibits conductive filament oxidation, ensures the extreme scalability of resistive switching memristors. This study renovates the understanding of the conductive filament evolution in HfO<sub>2</sub>-based memristors and provides potential inspirations to improve oxide memristors for nonvolatile storage-class memory applications.

    <title>Fatigue mechanism of NbO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; neuron device is unveiled</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<img data-src="/images/20231016-Fatigue mechanism of NbOx neuron device is revealed.jpg">
<p>Simulating the functionality of biological neurons is a prerequisite for establishing Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and forms the foundation for achieving future neuromorphic computing. Devices exhibiting threshold switching characteristics, owing to their highly nonlinear response to electrical bias, are widely employed in constructing artificial neuron devices. Threshold switching devices based on niobium oxide (NbO<sub>x</sub>) materials possess negative differential resistance characteristics, allowing for high switching speeds (&lt;2 ns) while maintaining low power consumption (~100 fJ), making them naturally suitable for constructing artificial neurons.</p>
<p>However, in practical operation, the application of cyclic electrical stress inevitably leads to changes in material properties. Of particular concern is the drift of the characteristic transition voltage, which significantly compromises the robustness of neural networks, often necessitating additional signal modulation to compensate in applications. Additionally, changes in the transition window alter the oscillation frequency of neuron device pulse emission, ultimately leading to device malfunction. Currently, research on device transition mechanisms primarily focuses on the macroscopic response of individual devices, such as the threshold transition process. There is still a lack of systematic research and abstract model descriptions of device degradation phenomena induced by cyclic electrical stress. This greatly hampers further improvement in device reliability.</p>
<p>Addressing the aforementioned critical issues, we constructed a threshold transition microscopic physical model for NbO<sub>x</sub>-based neuron devices, introducing the oxygen vacancy migration process induced by electric fields and thermal effects. This model not only effectively describes the threshold transition behavior and corresponding oxygen vacancy dynamics in NbO<sub>x</sub> devices but also successfully explains the performance degradation mechanism, especially the drift of threshold voltage (<em>V</em><sub>th</sub>) and holding voltage (<em>V</em><sub>hold</sub>), with simulation results highly consistent with experiments. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the comprehensive effects of electric field, temperature, and oxygen vacancy concentration gradients on the redistribution of oxygen vacancies in NbO<sub>x</sub> materials. Finally, we propose a method to mitigate device degradation by modulating the oxygen vacancy migration process, the effectiveness of which has been validated through simulation and experiments.</p>
<p><strong>The device reliability can be enhanced via optimizing the operation method:</strong><br>

    <title>Future of ferroelectric tunnel junction - nonvolatile or volatile?</title>
    <url>//2024-IMW-FTJ/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<style></style>
<img data-src="/images/20240513-Future of ferroelectric tunnel junction - nonvolatile or volatile?">
<p>Hafnia-based ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) have been suggested as one of the most promising candidates for emerging memory and computing technologies, thanks to their non-destructive readout, low power consumption, and CMOS and BEOL compatibility. Among all the reported FTJ structures, the Metal-Ferroelectric-Insulator-Metal (MFIM) one features a high endurance, excellent linearity of conductance modulations, and friendly 3D stackability.</p>
<p>FTJs exhibit either nonvolatile or volatile behavior, depending on the device stacks and the resulting depolarization field applied to the ferroelectric (FE) layer. A powerful FTJ model with more comprehensive physical mechanisms that can accurately capture the dynamics responses to depolarization, while maintaining computational efficiency, is essential for guiding device engineering to meet specific requirements of non-volatile (e.g., storage memory and neuromorphic synaptic device) and volatile (e.g., artificial neuron and reservoir computing) applications.</p>
<p>In this work, we present our efforts to develop such a high-efficient and comprehensive FTJ model based on an MFIM structure. Compared with the previously reported FTJ models, <em>i)</em> the multi-domain characteristics of polycrystalline HfO<sub>2</sub> FE films are modeled in a more efficient manner, by parameterizing the inhomogeneous mechanism into a partial differential equation (PDE), accurately capturing the polarization reversal dynamics; <em>ii)</em> the potential profile is calculated by a more thorough physical model including both the screening charge (SC) and image force (IF) effects; <em>iii)</em> for the first time, the dynamic retention behaviors and their dependence on key material parameters are systematically studied and discussed, in addition to the modeling of ON-state current density (<em>J</em><sub>ON</sub>) and the tunneling electroresistance (TER) ratio, which are crucial for both non-volatile and volatile applications.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>(Abstract) Synthetic ferromagnets (SFMs) possess the same layer structure found in the widely studied synthetic antiferromagnets. This consists of two ferromagnetic (FM) layers separated by a non-magnetic (NM) spacer forming the structure FM1/NM/FM2, but SFMs describe the case where the interlayer exchange coupling promotes the parallel alignment of the magnetizations of the FM layers. The frequency and phase of the dynamic response of these structures depends sensitively on the interlayer exchange coupling as well as on the individual layer magnetizations. Through experiments and numerical simulations, we show that the dynamic response of the two ferromagnetic layers has an orthogonal dependence on the difference in layer magnetization and interlayer coupling allowing both parameters to be determined accurately. In addition, we are able to obtain the phases of the resonant modes, a hitherto challenging measurement, and thus show that the conventional acoustic and optical description does not fully capture the intricacies of SFM dynamics. These findings are directly applicable to the creation of tailored SFMs for spintronic devices such as STT/SOT-MRAM where magnetization and interlayer coupling are key parameters.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<img width="50%" data-src="/images/230202_PSSW.jpg">
(Abstract) The exchange stiffness constant is recognized as one of the fundamental properties of magnetic materials, though its accurate experimental determination remains a particular challenge. In thin films, resonance measurements exploiting perpendicular standing spin waves (PSSWs) are increasingly used to extract this parameter, typically through a determination of the first-order PSSW mode. Here, we present a systematic study of multiple PSSW modes in NiFe films, where both the sample thickness and the cap layer material are varied. The results show that a simple analysis based on the Kittel rigid pinning model yields an exchange stiffness constant that varies with thickness, mode number, and capping layer material. This finding is clearly inconsistent with physical expectation that the exchange stiffness constant of a material is single valued for a particular set of thermodynamic conditions. Using a more general exchange boundary condition, we show, through a comprehensive set of micromagnetic simulations, that a dynamic pinning mechanism originally proposed by Wigen is able to reproduce the experimental results using a single value of Aex. Our findings support the utility of short wavelength, higher order PSSWs to determine the Aex of thin films and show that the value of Aex obtained has a weak dependency on the material immediately adjacent to the magnetic layer.

    <title>Surface roughness helps to stabilise out-of-plane spin textures in an uniformly in-plane magnetised system</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<img data-src="/images/201113_MeronlikeSpinTextures.png" width="50%">
<p>(Abstract) Interfacing magnetic materials with non-magnetic heavy metals with a large spin-orbit coupling, such as Pt, results in an asymmetric exchange interaction at the interface due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which in turn leads to the formation of skyrmions and topological spin structures in perpendicularly magnetised multilayers. Here we show that out of plane spin structures with lateral dimensions from 200 nm to 2μm are stabilised in in-plane magnetised Ta/Co/Pt trilayer structures. We show that these spin textures are largely insensitive to the direction of the in-plane magnetisation switched by either magnetic fields or electric fields applied across a Si3N4 gate dielectric. The results of micromagnetic simulations indicate that DMI is required for the stabilisation of such out of plane domains and that the presence of surface roughness helps to stabilise larger structures, in agreement with experimental results. We identify these spin structures as meron-like topological textures, characterized by a perpendicular spin texture in an uniformly in-plane magnetised system.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>(Abstract) Magnetic skyrmions have attracted considerable interest, especially after their recent experimental demonstration at room temperature in multilayers. The robustness, nanoscale size and non-volatility of skyrmions have triggered a substantial amount of research on skyrmion-based low-power, ultra-dense nanocomputing and neuromorphic systems such as artificial synapses. Room-temperature operation is required to integrate skyrmionic synapses in practical future devices. Here, we numerically propose a nanoscale skyrmionic synapse composed of magnetic multilayers that enables room-temperature device operation tailored for optimal synaptic resolution. We demonstrate that when embedding such multilayer skyrmionic synapses in a simple spiking neural network (SNN) with unsupervised learning via the spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule, we can achieve only a ∼78% classification accuracy in the MNIST handwritten data set under realistic conditions. We propose that this performance can be significantly improved to ∼98.61% by using a deep SNN with supervised learning. Our results illustrate that the proposed skyrmionic synapse can be a potential candidate for future energy-efficient neuromorphic edge computing.</p>

(Abstract) The topological properties of skyrmionic quasiparticles such as magnetic skyrmions and skyrmioniums enable their applications in future low-power, ultradense nanocomputing and neuromorphic systems. We propose here an all-magnetic skyrmionic interconnect, which has so far been the “missing component.” This interconnect will be of relevance to future spintronic circuits as well as quantum computing where nanofabricated interconnects need to operate at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we propose a nanoscale skyrmionic interconnect device that exploits topological selectivity to achieve signal multiplexing, thereby reducing the number of interconnects by 50% with no additional overhead for control signals. We utilize systematic micromagnetic calculations to evaluate operational parameters from ideal conditions (0 K) to room temperature in a tailor-designed magnetic multilayer heterostructure in order to demonstrate the potential of a skyrmion-based nanoscale spintronics interconnect. Finally, we introduce pipelining, which is achieved with strategically etched notches, in order to achieve a superior throughput in multiplexing and demultiplexing signals. Our proposal widens the possibilities for future spintronics-based nanocomputing.

(Abstract) Magnetic skyrmions have been in the spotlight since they were observed in technologically relevant systems at room temperature. More recently, there has been increasing interest in additional quasiparticles that may exist as stable/metastable spin textures in magnets, such as the skyrmionium and the antiskyrmionite (i.e., a skyrmion bag with two skyrmions inside) that have distinct topological characteristics. The next challenge and opportunity, at the same time, is to investigate the use of multiple magnetic quasiparticles as information carriers in a single device for next-generation nanocomputing. In this paper, we propose a spintronic interconnect device where multiple sequences of information signals are encoded and transmitted simultaneously by skyrmions, skyrmioniums, and antiskyrmionites. The proposed spintronic interconnect device can be pipelined via voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) gated synchronizers that behave as intermediate registers. We demonstrate theoretically that the interconnect throughput and transmission energy can be effectively tuned by the VCMA gate voltage and appropriate electric current pulses. By carefully adjusting the device structure characteristics, our spintronic interconnect device exhibits comparable energy efficiency with copper interconnects in mainstream CMOS technologies. This study provides fresh insight into the possibilities of skyrmionic devices in future spintronic applications.

Tailored magnetic multilayers (MMLs) provide skyrmions with enhanced thermal stability, leading to the possibility of skyrmion-based devices for room temperature applications. At the same time, the search for additional stable topological spin textures has been under intense research focus. Besides their fundamental importance, such textures may expand the information encoding capability of spintronic devices. However, fractional spin texture states within MMLs in the vertical dimension have yet to be investigated. In this work, we demonstrate numerically fractional skyrmion tubes (FSTs) in a tailored MML system. We subsequently propose to encode sequences of information signals with fractional skyrmion tubes (FSTs) as information bits in a tailored MML device. Micromagnetic simulations and theoretical calculations are used to verify the feasibility of hosting distinct FST states within a single device, and their thermal stability is investigated. A multilayer multiplexing device is proposed, where multiple sequences of the information signals can be encoded and transmitted based on the nucleation and propagation of packets of FSTs. Finally, pipelined information transmission and automatic demultiplexing is demonstrated by exploiting the skyrmion Hall effect and introducing voltage-controlled synchronizers and width-based track selectors. The findings indicate that FSTs can be potential candidates as information carriers for future spintronic applications.

<p>(Abstract) Magnetic phase transitions are a manifestation of competing interactions whose behavior is critically modified by defects and becomes even more complex when topological constraints are involved. In particular, the investigation of skyrmions and skyrmion lattices offers insight into fundamental processes of topological-charge creation and annihilation upon changing the magnetic state. Nonetheless, the exact physical mechanisms behind these phase transitions remain unresolved. Here, we show numerically that it is possible to collectively reverse the polarity of a skyrmion lattice in a field-induced first-order phase transition via a transient antiskyrmion-lattice state. We thus propose a new type of phase transformation where a skyrmion lattice inverts to another one due to topological constraints. In the presence of even a single defect, the process becomes a second-order phase transition with gradual topological-charge melting. This radical change in the system’s behavior from a first-order to a second-order phase transition demonstrates that defects in real materials could prevent us from observing collective topological phenomena. We have systematically compared ultra-thin films with isotropic and anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMIs), and demonstrated a nearly identical behavior for such technologically relevant interfacial systems.</p>

This study explores the stabilities of various topological spin textures in chiral magnets, such as chiral bobbers, dipole strings, and skyrmion tubes, against homochiral states. The study demonstrates multiple transition paths among these textures mediated by Bloch-point singularities and how the energy landscape of a magnetic system can be tailored by modulating local material properties. The key findings include the identification of ground-state chiral bobbers and the manipulation of stabilities and transition barriers of these textures. This research emphasizes the importance of understanding the energy barriers of transitions for the robustness of specific textures against external excitations, especially thermal fluctuations. It suggests that the topological protection property assists in maintaining the topological charge in a depth-dependent manner. Our study may have implications for future applications in spintronics-based information carriers.

    <title>When Bloch points hop through magnetic multilayers</title>

Magnetic multilayers are promising tunable systems for hosting magnetic skyrmions at/above room temperature. Revealing their intriguing switching mechanisms and associated inherent electrical responses are prerequisites for developing skyrmionic devices. In this Letter, we theoretically demonstrate the annihilation of single skyrmions occurring through a multilayer structure, which is mediated by the hopping dynamics of topological hedgehog singularities known as Bloch points. The emerging intralayer dynamics of Bloch points are dominated by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and their propagation can give rise to solenoidal emergent electric fields in the vicinity. Moreover, as the topology of spin textures can dominate their emergent magnetic properties, we show that the Bloch-point hopping through the multilayer will modulate the associated topological Hall response, with the magnitude proportional to the effective topological charge. We also investigate the thermodynamic stability of these states regarding the layer-dependent magnetic properties. This study casts light on the emergent electromagnetic signatures of skyrmion-based spintronics, rooted in magnetic-multilayer systems.

    <title>Design space of Hafnia-FeCap-based 6T2C-nvSRAM</title>

<p>Power consumption has become a significant challenge for embedded edge devices, as their applications towards the Internet of Things are limited by the capacity of battery powers or energy harvesting systems. Despite performing operations at low activity frequencies, the volatile nature of SRAM results in leakage currents dominating the overall energy consumption. One of the prevalent solutions involves integrating non-volatile modules into a volatile SRAM cell, thereby creating a non-volatile SRAM (nvSRAM). Existing nvSRAM architectures typically rely on the employment of phase change memory (PCM), resistive random access memory (RRAM), or magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), which usually require (1) additional transistors to suppress DC-short current of the non-volatile elements, (2) complex peripheral circuits and operation schemes to back up and recover the data bits regarding the memory properties, or (3) high dynamic power to operate the non-volatile units. Such scenarios can significantly increase the circuit complexity and energy consumption.</p>
<p>Polarization switching in ferroelectric materials has been widely studied and adopted for various types of memory technologies decades ago. However, the traditional perovskite-based ferroelectrics suffered from significant issues in their CMOS compatibility and physical thickness scalability. The recent discovery of ferroelectricity in CMOS-compatible HfO<sub>2</sub>-based thin films triggered a new wave of research interest in ferroelectric memory devices, demonstrating the great potential for their integration with advanced technology nodes and mass production. To date, different nvSRAM structures with HfO<sub>2</sub>-based ferroelectric capacitors (FeCaps) and ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) have been proposed and investigated, aiming at mitigating the above challenges faced by previous nvSRAM designs utilizing other emerging memory devices. Among them, the 6T2C nvSRAM cell, implemented by simply stacking a pair of FeCaps onto the 6T-SRAM portion, shows the simplest structure, requires the fewest extra fabrication steps, and hence, becomes one of the most intriguing options in terms of density and cost. Additionally, the more robust endurance and retention of the FeCaps, when compared with the FeFET, can ensure a longer nvSRAM lifetime for frequent data updating and storing. However, previous proof-of-concept work has only experimentally demonstrated the functionalities of the 6T2C nvSRAM based on HfO<sub>2</sub> FeCaps. Thorough evaluations of this type of devices, including their working principles and performance optimization, still await elucidation, which is critical for the further advancement of nvSRAM technologies.</p>
<p>In this work, we first develop a device model for Hafnia-FeCap-based 6T2C nvSRAMs. By presenting the interplay between transistor and FeCap properties, we comprehensively evaluate the working principle of each operation mode within single 6T2C cells. We propose optimization strategies aimed at achieving robust and energy-efficient Recall/Store operations. Meanwhile, potential side effects on conventional SRAM operation modes that can arise from the introduction of FeCaps are also discussed. We also analyze the static power consumption and break-even time to assess the competitiveness of the approach against the sleep-mode strategy used in volatile SRAMs. The proposed strategies towards performance optimization are summarize below:</p>

    <title>Duty-cycle induced degradation problem in Hafnia-based ferroelectric devices</title>
    <url>//2024-VLSI/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<style></style>
<p>Ferroelectric Random-Access Memory (FeRAM) based on Hf<sub>x</sub>Zr<sub>1-x</sub>O<sub>2</sub> materials has garnered widespread attention due to its high speed, excellent scalability, and compatibility with CMOS processes. However, the reliability of these devices is a key issue affecting their large-scale application. In read-intensive applications such as storage and artificial intelligence (AI), ferroelectric capacitors are neither frequently rewritten (as in traditional endurance tests), nor maintained in the same polarization state for a long period (as in traditional retention tests). Therefore, the reliability degradation and underlying physical mechanisms of devices in these application scenarios necessitates in-depth research.</p>
<p>Addressing these issues, we proposed a duty cycling endurance test method, involving different pulse duty ratios. The study found that during electrical testing, as the duty cycle decreases, the loss of polarization intensity (<em>P</em><sub>sw</sub>) and the shift in the switching voltage (<em>V</em><sub>c</sub>) become more pronounced, leading to faster device failure. Accordingly, we developed a three-dimensional physical model of ferroelectric devices incorporating the dynamics of oxygen vacancy defects and the Preisach polarization switching mechanism, revealing the failure mechanism driven by the redistribution of oxygen vacancies under the influence of electric fields and concentration gradients during duty cycling. Finally, we proposed the use of superlattice structures and the adjustment of Hf:Zr ratios to suppress the generation of oxygen vacancies under electrical stimuli, successfully mitigating the aforementioned failure behavior. This approach was validated on a 128 Kb Hafnia-based FeRAM chip, promoting broader applications of Hafnia-based ferroelectric memory technology.</p>
