Overview of my career 2013 - 2017 BEng (Materials Physics), University of Science and Technology Beijing, China 2016 - 2017 Research internship, Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMECAS), China 2017 - 2021 PhD (Magnetism and spintronics), University of Manchester, United Kingdom 2022 - now postdoc, Frontier Institute of Chip and System (FICS), Fudan University, China My undergraduate (2013 - 2017) I obtained my BEng degree in Materials Physics from the University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB), China. During my final year, I was fortunate to participate a captivating research internship project at the Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMECAS). I studied the modeling of the switching mechanisms for an emerging memory device known as resistive random access memory (RRAM)[1], under the expert supervision of Prof. Shibing Long. The experience provided me with invaluable insights and significantly heightened my interest in scientific research. Thus began my academic journey. My PhD （2017 - 2021） I commenced my academic journey by pursuing a PhD degree in the Skyrmionics team within the Nano Engineering and Spintronic Technologies (NEST) Group at the University of Manchester, UK (2017 – 2022). My studies were funded by the School of Computer Science Kilburn Overseas Fee Bursary and CSC scholarship. My PhD supervisors are Prof. Jim Miles and Dr. Christoforos Moutafis. My research primarily focused on theoretical &amp; computational studies of magnetic objects, with emphasis on three main dimensions: Dynamics of nanoscale magnetic objects [2][3], including magnetic skyrmion, antiskyrmion, and chiral bobber, within the bulk magnet and multilayer thin films; Their thermal stabilities and minimum energy paths to other possible equilibrium states[4]; Electronic transport properties of different objects aimed at future detection and applications[3:1][4:1]. Furthermore, I delved into various intriguing research topics such as the roughness effect on skyrmion stability[5], ferromagnetic resonance of RKKY-coupled[6] or surface-pinned magnetic materials[7], skyrmion-based devices for emerging applications such as neuromorphic computing[8][9][10]. The successful completion of these projects was made possible through board collaborations with talented people in our NEST group@UoM, ETH Zurich, Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), and LMU München, etc. Link to my PhD thesis. My postdoc (2022 - now) After completing my PhD, I started working as a postdoc at Fudan University. My current research interest continues to focuse on device modeling, with a slight shift towards exploring the potential of ferroelectric materials. The topics cover the fundamental polarization switching mechanism, defect generation &amp; migration during electrical cyclings, and circuit-level abstraction of ferroelectric phenomena for SPICE simulators. Particularly, my SPICE models highlight the interplay between ferroelectric &amp; dielectric layers, as well as Fe-based devices (eg., FeCap and FTJ) and transistors (eg. MOSFET and TFT). As of April 2024, I have published over 17 papers in academic journals &amp; conferences, including Small, Phys. Rev. B/Research, IEEE Trans. Electron Devices, and Nat. Comm. Among these, I am the first/corresponding author on 7 papers. My Google Scholar citations are above 400 with an h-index of 8. Contact me Y. Li, M. Zhang, S. Long*, J. Teng, Q. Liu, H. Lv, E.

Among all the reported FTJ structures, the Metal-Ferroelectric-Insulator-Metal (MFIM) one features a high endurance, excellent linearity of conductance modulations, and friendly 3D stackability. FTJs exhibit either nonvolatile or volatile behavior, depending on the device stacks and the resulting depolarization field applied to the ferroelectric (FE) layer. A powerful FTJ model with more comprehensive physical mechanisms that can accurately capture the dynamics responses to depolarization, while maintaining computational efficiency, is essential for guiding device engineering to meet specific requirements of non-volatile (e.g., storage memory and neuromorphic synaptic device) and volatile (e.g., artificial neuron and reservoir computing) applications. In this work, we present our efforts to develop such a high-efficient and comprehensive FTJ model based on an MFIM structure. Compared with the previously reported FTJ models, i) the multi-domain characteristics of polycrystalline HfO2 FE films are modeled in a more efficient manner, by parameterizing the inhomogeneous mechanism into a partial differential equation (PDE), accurately capturing the polarization reversal dynamics; ii) the potential profile is calculated by a more thorough physical model including both the screening charge (SC) and image force (IF) effects; iii) for the first time, the dynamic retention behaviors and their dependence on key material parameters are systematically studied and discussed, in addition to the modeling of ON-state current density (JON) and the tunneling electroresistance (TER) ratio, which are crucial for both non-volatile and volatile applications.

The paper contributes to optimizing the performance of NbOx-based devices for artificial neuron applications.","text":"Simulating the functionality of biological neurons is a prerequisite for establishing Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and forms the foundation for achieving future neuromorphic computing. Devices exhibiting threshold switching characteristics, owing to their highly nonlinear response to electrical bias, are widely employed in constructing artificial neuron devices. Threshold switching devices based on niobium oxide (NbOx) materials possess negative differential resistance characteristics, allowing for high switching speeds (&lt; 2 ns) while maintaining low power consumption (~100 fJ), making them naturally suitable for constructing artificial neurons. However, in practical operation, the application of cyclic electrical stress inevitably leads to changes in material properties. Of particular concern is the drift of the characteristic transition voltage, which significantly compromises the robustness of neural networks, often necessitating additional signal modulation to compensate in applications. Additionally, changes in the transition window alter the oscillation frequency of neuron device pulse emission, ultimately leading to device malfunction. Currently, research on device transition mechanisms primarily focuses on the macroscopic response of individual devices, such as the threshold transition process. There is still a lack of systematic research and abstract model descriptions of device degradation phenomena induced by cyclic electrical stress. This greatly hampers further improvement in device reliability. Addressing the aforementioned critical issues, we constructed a threshold transition microscopic physical model for NbOx-based neuron devices, introducing the oxygen vacancy migration process induced by electric fields and thermal effects. This model not only effectively describes the threshold transition behavior and corresponding oxygen vacancy dynamics in NbOx devices but also successfully explains the performance degradation mechanism, especially the drift of threshold voltage (Vth) and holding voltage (Vhold), with simulation results highly consistent with experiments. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the comprehensive effects of electric field, temperature, and oxygen vacancy concentration gradients on the redistribution of oxygen vacancies in NbOx materials. Finally, we propose a method to mitigate device degradation by modulating the oxygen vacancy migration process, the effectiveness of which has been validated through simulation and experiments. The device reliability can be enhanced via optimizing the operation method: p{} .ref p{ line-height:20px;font-size:80%;margin:0 auto;padding:0px 0} Reference Fatigue of NbOx-based locally active memristors— (1) Part I: Experimental Characteristics Y.

Besides their fundamental importance, such textures may expand the information encoding capability of spintronic devices. However, fractional spin texture states within MMLs in the vertical dimension have yet to be investigated. In this work, we demonstrate numerically fractional skyrmion tubes (FSTs) in a tailored MML system. We subsequently propose to encode sequences of information signals with fractional skyrmion tubes (FSTs) as information bits in a tailored MML device. Micromagnetic simulations and theoretical calculations are used to verify the feasibility of hosting distinct FST states within a single device, and their thermal stability is investigated. A multilayer multiplexing device is proposed, where multiple sequences of the information signals can be encoded and transmitted based on the nucleation and propagation of packets of FSTs. Finally, pipelined information transmission and automatic demultiplexing is demonstrated by exploiting the skyrmion Hall effect and introducing voltage-controlled synchronizers and width-based track selectors. The findings indicate that FSTs can be potential candidates as information carriers for future spintronic applications. p{} .ref p{ line-height:20px;font-size:80%;margin:0 auto;padding:0px 0} Reference Encoding and multiplexing information signals in magnetic multilayers with fractional skyrmion tubes R.

However, the dynamic changes in the resistive switching process, including the composition and structure of conductive filaments, and especially the evolution of conductive filament surroundings, remain controversial in HfO2-based memristors. Here, the conductive filament system in the amorphous HfO2-based memristors with various top electrodes is revealed to be with a quasi-core-shell structure consisting of metallic hexagonal-Hf6O and its crystalline surroundings (monoclinic or tetragonal HfOx). The phase of the HfOx shell varies with the oxygen reservation capability of the top electrode. According to extensive high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations and ab initio calculations, the phase transition of the conductive filament shell between monoclinic and tetragonal HfO2 is proposed to depend on the comprehensive effects of Joule heat from the conductive filament current and the concentration of oxygen vacancies. The quasi-core-shell conductive filament system with an intrinsic barrier, which prohibits conductive filament oxidation, ensures the extreme scalability of resistive switching memristors.

In this Letter, we theoretically demonstrate the annihilation of single skyrmions occurring through a multilayer structure, which is mediated by the hopping dynamics of topological hedgehog singularities known as Bloch points. The emerging intralayer dynamics of Bloch points are dominated by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and their propagation can give rise to solenoidal emergent electric fields in the vicinity. Moreover, as the topology of spin textures can dominate their emergent magnetic properties, we show that the Bloch-point hopping through the multilayer will modulate the associated topological Hall response, with the magnitude proportional to the effective topological charge.

The spacial variation is determined by the surface topography of multilayer structure, which is characterised by atomic force microscopy. By using micromagnetic technique, we found that the DMI is required for the stabilisation of meron-like spin textures in an in-plane magnetised [Pt/Co/Ta] trilayer structure. Furthermore, with the presence of surface roughness, much larger textures can be stabilised with lateral dimensions from 0.2 to 2 μm, in agreement with experimental observations. Please find more out in our published paper!","text":"(Abstract) Interfacing magnetic materials with non-magnetic heavy metals with a large spin-orbit coupling, such as Pt, results in an asymmetric exchange interaction at the interface due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which in turn leads to the formation of skyrmions and topological spin structures in perpendicularly magnetised multilayers. Here we show that out of plane spin structures with lateral dimensions from 200 nm to 2μm are stabilised in in-plane magnetised Ta/Co/Pt trilayer structures. We show that these spin textures are largely insensitive to the direction of the in-plane magnetisation switched by either magnetic fields or electric fields applied across a Si3N4 gate dielectric. The results of micromagnetic simulations indicate that DMI is required for the stabilisation of such out of plane domains and that the presence of surface roughness helps to stabilise larger structures, in agreement with experimental results. We identify these spin structures as meron-like topological textures, characterized by a perpendicular spin texture in an uniformly in-plane magnetised system. p{} .ref p{ line-height:20px;font-size:80%;margin:0 auto;padding:0px 0} Reference Meronlike spin textures in in-plane-magnetized thin films J.

The development of practical devices relies on a detailed understanding of how skyrmionic structures can be formed, transferred, detected, and annihilated. In this work our considerations go beyond static skyrmions and theoretically show that the formation/annihilation of both skyrmions and antiskyrmions is enabled by the transient creation and propagation of topological singularities (magnetic monopolelike Bloch points). Critically, our results predict that during the winding/unwinding of skyrmionic textures, the Bloch-point propagation will give rise to an emergent electric field with a substantial amplitude and in the terahertz frequency range. We also demonstrate ways for controlling Bloch-point dynamics, which directly enable the tunablility on generation of this signal, as well as its frequency and amplitude.

Room-temperature operation is required to integrate skyrmionic synapses in practical future devices. Here, we numerically propose a nanoscale skyrmionic synapse composed of magnetic multilayers that enables room-temperature device operation tailored for optimal synaptic resolution. We demonstrate that when embedding such multilayer skyrmionic synapses in a simple spiking neural network (SNN) with unsupervised learning via the spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule, we can achieve only a ∼78% classification accuracy in the MNIST handwritten data set under realistic conditions. We propose that this performance can be significantly improved to ∼98.61% by using a deep SNN with supervised learning.

In particular, the investigation of skyrmions and skyrmion lattices offers insight into fundamental processes of topological-charge creation and annihilation upon changing the magnetic state. Nonetheless, the exact physical mechanisms behind these phase transitions remain unresolved. Here, we show numerically that it is possible to collectively reverse the polarity of a skyrmion lattice in a field-induced first-order phase transition via a transient antiskyrmion-lattice state. We thus propose a new type of phase transformation where a skyrmion lattice inverts to another one due to topological constraints. In the presence of even a single defect, the process becomes a second-order phase transition with gradual topological-charge melting. This radical change in the system’s behavior from a first-order to a second-order phase transition demonstrates that defects in real materials could prevent us from observing collective topological phenomena. We have systematically compared ultra-thin films with isotropic and anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMIs), and demonstrated a nearly identical behavior for such technologically relevant interfacial systems. p{} .ref p{ line-height:20px;font-size:80%;margin:0 auto;padding:0px 0} Reference Collective antiskyrmion-mediated phase transition and defect-induced melting in chiral magnetic films L.

In this paper, a universal Monte Carlo simulator is developed based on a cell switching model and a tunneling-based transport model. Driven by external electric field, the growing process of the nanoscale filament occurring in the gap region is actually dominated by cells’ conductive/insulating switching, modeled through a phenomenological physics-based probability function. The electric transport through the partially formed CF is considered as current tunneling in the framework of the Quantum Point Contact model, and the potential barrier is modulated during cells’ evolution. To demonstrate the validity and universality of our simulator, various operation schemes are simulated, with the simulated I-V characteristics well explaining experimental observations. Furthermore, the statistical analyses of simulation results in terms of Weibull distribution and conductance evolution also nicely track previous experimental results. Representing a simulation scale that links atomic-scale simulations to compact modeling, our simulator has the advantage of being much faster comparing with other atomic-scale models. Meanwhile, our simulator shows good universality since it can be applied to various operation signals, and also to different electrodes and dielectric layers dominated by different switching mechanisms. p{} .ref p{ line-height:20px;font-size:80%;margin:0 auto;padding:0px 0} Reference Investigation on the conductive filament growth dynamics in resistive switching memory via a universal Monte Carlo simulator Y.

Filamentary switching based on the formation and rupture of nanoscale conductive filament has been applied in non-volatile memory and volatile selector devices with low power consumption and fast switching speeds. Before the mass production of resistive switching devices, great efforts are still required to enable stable and reliable switching performances. The conductive filament, a bridge of microscopic metal-insulator-metal structure and macroscopic resistance states, plays an irreplaceable part in resistive switching behavior, as unreliable performance often originates from unstable filament behavior. In this Review, departing from the filamentary switching mechanism and the existing issues, recent advances of the switching performance improvement through the conductive filament modulation are discussed, in the sequence of material modulation, device structure design and switching operation scheme optimization. In particular, two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials with excellent properties including and beyond graphene, are discussed with emphasis on performance improvement by their active roles as the switching layer, insertion layer, thin electrode, patterned electrode, and edge electrode, etc. p{} .ref p{ line-height:20px;font-size:80%;margin:0 auto;padding:0px 0} Reference Resistive switching performance improvement via modulating nanoscale conductive filament, involving the application of two‐dimensional layered materials Y.
